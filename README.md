# Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics

In the following notebook, I have demonstrated my ability to utilize PostgreSQL.
I have answered the following questions below: 

1. What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?
2. What are the distinct debt indicators?
3. What is the total amount of debt owed by all the countries present in the table, in millions?
4. What country has the highest amount of debt?
5. What is the average amount of debt across different debt indicators?
6. What is the highest amount of principal repayments in the "DT.AMT.DLXF.CD" category?
